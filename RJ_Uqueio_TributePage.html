        <h2>Here is a timeline about the lives of our extremely inteligent "human computers"</h2>
          <h4><u>Mary Jackson (engineer)</u></h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>1921</b>- Born in Hampton, Virginia </li><br/>
            <li><b>1942</b>- Earns bachelor's degrees in mathematics and physical science from Hampton University</li><br/>
            <li><b>1953</b>- Accepts an offer to work for engineer Kazimierz Czarnecki in the Supersonic Pressure Tunnel</li><br/>
            <li><b>1958</b>- She is promoted to aerospace engineer and becames NASA's first black female engineer. </li><br/>
            <li><b></b>She ultimately authors or co-authors 12 technical papers for NACA and NASA and She works to help women and other minorities to advance their careers, including advising them how to study in order to qualify for promotions</li><br/>
            <li><b>1975</b>- Jackson achieves the most senior title within the engineering department. She decides to take a demotion in order to serve as an administrator in the Equal Opportunity Specialist field. She continued to work at NASA until her retirement in 1985. </li><br/>
            <li><b>1969-2020</b>- Recieves many awards and honors.</li><br/>

          <h4><u>Katherine Johnson (mathematician)</u></h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>1918</b>- Born in White Sulphur Springs,West Virginia </li><br/>
            <li><b>1937</b>- Graduates summa cum laude with degrees in mathematics and French at age 18</li><br/>
            <li><b>1953-1958</b>- works as a computer,analyzing topics such as gust alleviation for aircraft National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA).</li><br/>
            <li><b>1961</b>-  She calculates the trajectory for the May 5, space flight of Alan Shepard, the first American in space.Her work helps to ensure that Alan Shepard's Freedom 7 Mercury capsule would be found quickly after landing, using the accurate trajectory that had been established.</li><br/>
            <li><b>1969</b>- She helps to calculate the trajectory for the Apollo 11 flight to the Moon.</li><br/>
            <li><b>1970</b>- Johnson works on the Apollo 13 Moon mission. When the mission is aborted, her work on backup procedures and charts help set a safe path for the crew's return to Earth, creating a one-star observation system that would allow astronauts to determine their location with accuracy.</li><br/>
            <li><b>1971-2021</b>- Recieves countless honors and awards.</li><br/>
            <li><b>2020</b>- Katherine Johnson dies at age 101.</li>

            <li><b>1943</b>- Vaughan begins a 28-year-career as a mathematician and programmer at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, in which she specializes in calculations for flight paths, the Scout Project, and computer programming.</li><br/>
            <li><b>1949</b>-  She is assigned as the acting head of the West Area Computers, taking over from a white woman who had died. She becomes the first black supervisor at NACA and one of few female supervisors, leading a group composed entirely of African-American women mathematicians</li><br/>
            <li><b>1961</b>- Vaughan moves into the area of electronic computing and becomes proficient in computer programming, teaching herself FORTRAN and teaching it to her coworkers to prepare them for the transition. </li><br/>
            <li><b>1971</b>- She retires from NASA.</li><br/>
